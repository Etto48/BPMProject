We successfully developed AIRA, an AI-powered
Risk Analysis web application that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) to quicken and enhance the risk discovery
process in project management. AIRA assists users through
a structured workflow that includes context definition,
risk discovery, qualitative analysis, planning, and
overview. By integrating Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
methodologies, AIRA ensures that users remain actively
involved in the risk analysis process, allowing for
personalization and refinement of the results, avoiding
LLMs pitfalls.

The current system could be improved by swapping the
local LLMs with more powerful cloud-hosted models to
enhance the quality of risk identification and analysis.
Also, using more information about the current and 
past projects of the user could help tailoring the
risk analysis even further.
