Effective Risk Analysis is crucial in project management.
Correctly identifying potential risks allows teams to 
mitigate potential threats and exploit opportunities.
This leads to the successful completion of projects
within scope, time, and budget constraints.
    
Traditional methods of risk discovery are often slow
and rely on human intuition, group dynamics, and experience.
This can lead to biases, oversights, and incomplete coverage
of potential risks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brainstorming} can be dominated by vocal or
    influential participants, leading to groupthink.
    \item \textbf{Pre-mortem analysis} relies on the imagination
    of team members, which may overlook less obvious risks.
    \item \textbf{Affinity diagrams} are an additional step
    that do not generate new risks by themselves, they instead
    rely on the creativity of participants.
    \item \textbf{Delphi method} can be effective but is
    time-consuming and may require multiple rounds to
    reach consensus, and it may still be biased by
    participants' perspectives.
\end{itemize}

To address these challenges, we propose AIRA, an AI-powered
Risk Analysis tool that uses Large Language Models (LLMs)
to speed up and enhance the risk discovery process.
By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs and integrating
them with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) methodologies, AIRA
aims to provide a more efficient and effective approach
to risk analysis in project management.
